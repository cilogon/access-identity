Avoid Creating Duplicate Accounts
---------------------------------
If you already have an XSEDE or ACCESS account, please do not create another one.
You can [request a username reminder](/username-reminder) and/or [reset your password](/password-reset) to continue using an existing account.
If you're having trouble accessing an existing account, please [contact us](/help) rather than creating another one.

Two Options for New User Registration
-------------------------------------
If you don't already have an XSEDE or ACCESS account, there are two registration options:
1. [Register with an existing identity](/new-user-federated): Using an existing GitHub, Google, Microsoft, ORCID, or University account when registering with ACCESS simplifies the sign-up process and enables you to log in to ACCESS using that existing account. With this option, creating an ACCESS-specific password is optional during registration, and you will also have the option to create an ACCESS-specific password later if needed.
2. [Register without an existing identity](/new-user-direct): With this option, you'll be prompted to enter all your registration info and select an ACCESS-specific password. You can [link](/link) a GitHub, Google, Microsoft, ORCID, or University account later if desired.
