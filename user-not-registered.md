This error occurs when ACCESS can not locate your entry in the ACCESS User Database when logging in.

If you have an ACCESS or XSEDE account:
* Please do not create a new ACCESS ID.
* Please click the "Delete ALL" button at <https://cilogon.org/me/> and try again.
* Select the "ACCESS CI" identity provider to log in with your ACCESS/XSEDE username and password.
* If you would like to log in to ACCESS using an identity provider other than "ACCESS CI", you need to link your identity from that other identity provider with your ACCESS account. Please proceed to the [identity linking](/id-linking) page for details.

If you do not already have an ACCESS or XSEDE account:
* Please [register](/new-user).
