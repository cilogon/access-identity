title: "Error: User Not Registered with ACCESS"
---

This error occurs when ACCESS can not locate the user in the ACCESS User Database when logging in.

It may be a temporary error caused by a system outage. Please wait a few minutes and try again.

Do you have an ACCESS user account? If not, please register. (REGISTRATION LINK COMING SOON.)

Do you want to log in with an external federated identity that is not yet linked with your ACCESS user account? If yes, please proceed with identity linking. (IDENTITY LINKING COMING SOON.)
