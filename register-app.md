ACCESS uses CILogon COmanage for OpenID Connect (OIDC) web
application registration and management.
Please contact [help@cilogon.org](mailto:help@cilogon.org)
(Subject: ACCESS OIDC client management) to request an invitation.
In your email message, please specify your ACCESS affiliation:
* RAMPS (Track 1)
* MATCH (Track 2)

* MMS (Track 4)
* OpenCI (ACO)
* Service Provider

After you have registered with CILogon COmanage, see [COmanage
OIDC Clients](https://www.cilogon.org/comanage/oidc-clients) for
information on registering and managing OIDC clients. Note that
there is a "Named Configuration" available for ACCESS which
performs special processing of the asserted claims. Be sure to
check the appropriate checkboxes if this is a feature you want for
your client.
