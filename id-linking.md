title: "Identity Linking"
---

Identity linking is the process required to link a GitHub, Google, Microsoft, ORCID, or University account with an ACCESS ID so that you can log on to ACCESS services using the linked account. Please review the instructions below to link or unlink an account.

## Link

Linking is a two-step process:
1. Authenticate to your ACCESS ID using the "ACCESS CI" identity provider or an account that is already linked to your ACCESS ID.
2. Authenticate using the identity provider for the account that you want to link to your ACCESS ID.
Please carefully select the appropriate identity provider at each step in the process.

When ready, visit <https://identity.access-ci.org/link> to initiate the linking process.

## Unlink
